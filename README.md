Perfect 👍
Main tumhare **Feature Selection + Model Training notebook** aur **Streamlit frontend (app.py)** ko dhyaan me rakh kar **ready-to-use README.md** bana raha hoon, jo tum directly **GitHub repo me copy-paste** kar sakti ho.

## 📘 README.md (GitHub ke liye)

```markdown
# 🛡️ AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (IDS)

An end-to-end **Machine Learning based Network Intrusion Detection System** that detects malicious network traffic using selected network flow features and a trained Random Forest model.  
The project also includes an **interactive Streamlit dashboard** for real-time, batch, and manual traffic analysis.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project demonstrates the integration of **Cybersecurity + Machine Learning** by detecting network intrusions from traffic data.  
The model is trained on selected features inspired by the **CICIDS-2017 dataset**, and the predictions are visualized through a user-friendly web interface.

## ⚙️ Key Features

- 🔍 **Feature Selection & Model Training**
- 🌲 **Random Forest Classifier**
- 📊 **Streamlit Interactive Dashboard**
- 📁 **Batch CSV Traffic Scanning**
- 🔬 **Manual Packet Analysis**
- 🔴 **Live Network Packet Monitoring**
- 📈 **Real-time Alerts & Visualization**

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Workflow

1. Data preprocessing and cleaning  
2. Feature selection  
3. Feature scaling  
4. Model training using Random Forest  
5. Saving trained artifacts  
6. Prediction using Streamlit frontend
